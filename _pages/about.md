Welcome to my portfolio! Throughout my professional career and growing up in the Bay Area, I have always been a scientist in the field of synthetic biology, particularly in yeast metabolic engineering. Realizing the amount of data I generated throughout experiments, and curious to finding more efficient ways to process and analyze these data, I have chosen to learn more about the realm of data science. With the emphasis  on data science, I can utilize what I have learned throughout my graduate program to be able to take my experiments from designing, planning, executing, generating data, processing, analyzing, predicting through machine learning, and have a great storytelling for the audience about my findings and results.
