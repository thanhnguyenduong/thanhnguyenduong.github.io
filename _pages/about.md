Welcome to my portfolio! Throughout my professional career and growing up in the Bay Area, I have always been a scientist in the field of synthetic biology particularly in yeast metabolic engineering. Realizing the amount of data I generated throughout experiments, and curious to finding a more efficient ways to process and analyze these data, I have chosen to focus and learn more about data science realm. With my emphasis being on data science, I can utilize what I have learned throughout the graduate program to be able to take my experiments from designing, planning, executing, generating data, processing, analyzing, and have a great storytelling to the audience of my findings and results.
