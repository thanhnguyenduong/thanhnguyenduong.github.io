 **Part 3** 
  Split Train Test & Model Selection and Evaluation  

## Objective
  The objective of this project was to get familiar with how a case study work and learning to perform data analysis from start to finish as well as creating a predictive model through training and testing the models. The model that I chose for this case study was logistic regression.
